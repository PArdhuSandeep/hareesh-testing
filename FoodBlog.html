        <h2>Sushi</h2>
        <p>
          Sushi notes: prepared with a variety of ingredients, including
          seafood, vegetables, and occasionally fruits, together with vinegared
          rice. The ideal accompaniments to sushi are wasabi, pickled ginger,
          and soy sauce. Daikon radish is a common garnish for this dish. A
          sushi's flavour is determined by the kind of fish used. Yet, the
          dish's overall flavour is acidic due to the vinegared rice. When
          compared to octopus-flavored sushi, tuna, eel, and salmon often have a
          subtle flavour.
